Mechanical engineer who made a career transition to web development.
I took the Labenu Dev FullStack course developing applications with React.js, Node and typeScript (available on GitHub link).
I also did an exchange program at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), in which I participated in a research in the area of ​Finite Elements, and where I started to develop some skills and taste for programming.
